Automatic update tool for AdoptOpenJDK releasesÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â [Download](#download)

## ðŸ’¡ Key ideas

* The updater tries to list all AdoptOpenJDK installations on your machine - automatically
* Every time it launches (i.e., scheduled on logon), it checks for updates in background
* If there are new versions, you will be notified
* **For advanced users:** It also provides a lot of manual controls - but they require some fine-tuning. Just read the tooltips, there are tons of them.

![Config Dialog](/docs/config_dialog.png?raw=true)

When this app launches, it gets versions for your local installations of JDK/JRE (either from Windows Registry or from `release` file). Then it queries AdoptOpenJDK API to check if there are versions newer than yours. 
If there is, you will be notified. Otherwise app quits without showing any windows or alerts.

Configuration window will appear only on first run or if something goes wrong or if you have explicitly called it by the corresponding shortcut (or `-config` argument).

This app is designed to run on Windows startup. I recommend to turn on **Check for AdoptOpenJDK updates on Logon** setting in configuration. If you want another schedule, turn this on and press Edit task to configure it as desired.

## ðŸ”ƒ New in v. 2.0.0
* Support for multiple AdoptOpenJDK installations
* Redesigned UI/UX
* App warns if `N` last *consecutive* update checks were unsuccessful *(default N=10)*
* Limited support for `Most recent`/ `Most recent LTS` options
* Other improvements, perfomance optimisations etc.


## â„¹ Requirements
Ironically, this tool is written in C# 6 + WPF, because I am not a Java developer xD
* Windows 10 _(earlier versions are likely to work as well, but I did not test that)_
* .NET Framework 4.7.2 _(the installer will do it for you)_

## ðŸ“© Download
`[!!!]` **âš  Version 2, described here, has not been released yet. New release is expected in 1-2 days. Currently you can download v.1, which will update itself to v.2 once it will be released.**
[Download version 1, that supports only 1 installation](https://github.com/tushev/aojdk-updatewatcher/releases)

**If you find this app useful, stars are appreciated :)**

There's a built-in update mechanism. 

## ðŸ›  Installation & configuration
0. Run the downloaded installer and run the app _(internet connection highly recommended on first run :)_
1. **Turn on `Check for AdoptOpenJDK updates on Logon`**. _(If you want another schedule, turn this on and press Edit task to configure it as desired)_.
2. **Turn on automatic discovery of AdoptOpenJDK installations**.
> Please note that only MSI-installed JDKs/JREs can be discovered (because only MSIs add corresponding registry keys automatically)
 
 **That's all!**

##
If you don't have any JDKs/JREs installed, click on **Download and install new instance from the web** and the app will download and install them for you:

## ðŸ’¡ Philosophy
* This app is silent during background checks. If there is a problem connecting to the internet or AdoptOpenJDK API does not respond, it will be silent, unless `N` *consecutive* update checks were unsuccessful *(default N=10)*
* However, it will not be silent in UI.
* I'm not going to actively develop this app, it's mostly 'fire-and-forget' thing. However, some functionality may be added in future, there's a built-in update mechanism.

## ðŸ’» Codestyle
v.1.0: Please don't judge my coding style by this project, as I developed this app in less than a working day. It just works :)

v.2.0: The app was refactored. However, some codestyle issues still remain - for a single-person-maintained project, they are not a major issue. My top priority is app stability and robustness.

## ðŸ”• Known not-a-bugs
* **JAVA_HOME** value is updated when the *app is launched* (either in configuration mode or during background check). If you change JAVA_HOME value while running configuration screen, the value will not be updated in the app. However, you can close the configuration window safely: when the next background check occurs, actual value of JAVA_HOME at that time will be used 
* If the configuration app **continiously** reminds you to turn on scheduled task (even if you opted out before), this happens because you have not either added some installations manually, or turned auto-discovery on. Once you set at least one of these, the app will consider itself as 'configured' and will remember your opt-out.
